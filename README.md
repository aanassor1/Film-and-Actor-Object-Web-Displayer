## Description

In second year of university, we were tasked with creaing a Java Spring Web App using the fundamentals taught to us.

We had to create a two base classes (Actor, Film), and create a controller for both of them. These controllers control the view of each class as well as allowing the user to create new objects.

The classes also includes validation of data for security reasons. After, we display the basic data of each object to the user on the web app.

## Installation

Go onto Github, find the project and clone the repository.
Afterwards, open bash, locate the destinated file with 'cd', and use git clone on the cloned repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aanassor1/Film-and-Actor-Object-Web-Displayer.git
```

After, create a java product on an IDE that allows packages. Then create a package for each folder (Domain, resources, controller) and then put in the respective children in each of those folders. Put the views folder into the main project folder and the HW1Application.java file.

Then, run the HW1Application file and on your website, open up the website - http://localhost:8080/.
